          <h3>C programming</h3>
          <p>
            C programming is special to me because it was my step first programming language. I started programming when I was in my 9th class. I started with Python but as 10 came I stopped coding and focused on my boards. I started to code again in my class 11th aiming to complete python this time and not leaving it like in class 10th and eventually I got very interested in it. I started to learn Python and C simultaneously.And therefore C is my step-first programming language.

          <h3>Java programming</h3>
          <p>
            Java is one of my favorite programming languages. I learnt Data structure and algorithms using java. I first came to know about OOPS concepts when I was learning java in my class 11th.
